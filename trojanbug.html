          </div>
          <p class="text-justify">I am an architect. A pragmatic one. Completely immune to hype. One, who will tell you what I think your problem is, and not make you pay for solving the non-existent. Will fight, if needed, against you, if it is beneficial for you to be stopped. I have no problem admitting I have no clue, and so refuse to develop solutions I don't understand. It does not make me easy to work with, but it makes my projects successful. Up to the very moment â€“ all of them.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">I am a manager. One who led distributed, multicultural teams through nightmarish projects, 70h workweeks and deadlines set two years back in time. One, who still have friends recruiting from those teams, who want and sometimes ask us to work together again. One, who has enemies, for it takes to make some the team to be built and the outcome delivered.</p>
          <p class="text-justify"><a href="#rocket">I did some rocket science, while working for Polish Air Forces</a>, for quite a few years. Switched to higher math (addition, subtraction, occasional multiplication), called banking, some 10 years ago.</p>
          <div class="col-md-4 pull-left">
            <img src="img/cv/calc.jpg" class="img-responsive" alt="Addition, substraction, occassional multiplication ...">
          </div>
          <p class="text-justify">Since then I have participated in several projects of creating a bank from scratch: a greenfield recreation of a fully digital bank, a supermarket bank bringing its bank operations in-house, and a challenger.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">I have done major migrations. Owned a middleware product. Migrated several tens of APIs to a new platform.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">I am a recognized Open Banking movement contributor. Author (architect and initiator) of an early <a href="https://okapi.intive.com">open banking API framework</a>, and and soon to become leader of the PSD2 implementation program for a tier 1 bank.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">Spent some 10 years doing all that. And more.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">When it comes to system integration, there is little I have not tried. Been there, done that.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">In early two-thousands I have designed from scratch a distributed Command & Control system to support Electronic Warfare & Surveillance for Polish Air Forces. Something that on the surface resembles the illustration below.</p>
          <a name="rocket"></a>
          <p class="text-justify"></p>
          <div class="col-md-8 pull-right">
            <img src="img/cv/rap.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Command & Control System">
          </div>
          <p class="text-justify"></p>
          <p class="text-justify">Many know banking better than I do. You can find better programmers. There are skillful integration architects, and business architects, too. There are way better managers. But there are very few people who can do it all well. I can. No false modesty.</p>
          <p class="text-justify">If you need a truly holistic approach, synthetic thinking and ability to see patterns, where others see isolated problems - <span class="color-aqua">I am your man</span>.</p>
